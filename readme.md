# Docker Compose Collection

![Docker Logo](docker-logo.png)

Welcome to my personal collection of Docker Compose files! This repository serves as a storage place for various Docker Compose configurations that I find useful for my projects. Feel free to explore and use these files as a reference or starting point for your own Dockerized applications.


## Introduction

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you can define your application's services, networks, and volumes in a single `docker-compose.yml` file, making it easier to manage and deploy complex applications.

This repository contains a collection of various Docker Compose files that cover different use cases and scenarios. It's organized to help you quickly find configurations relevant to your project.

## Getting Started

To use the Docker Compose files from this repository, you'll need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. If you haven't installed them yet, follow the official installation guides:

- [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once you have Docker and Docker Compose set up, you can simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ihsbramn/docker-compose-collection.git
cd "desired directory"
docker compose up -d
